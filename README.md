# url-shortering

The ultimate goal of my project is to give users the ability to shorten long links for ease of use. To do this, I created a landing page with a form that uses a third-party API to shorten links. The user enters a long link into the form, which sends a request to the API to shorten the link. The shortened version of the link is then displayed, which the user can copy and use.
